# BitPic
<sp>
 This is an app which uses feature detection to suggest search terms for your bitmojis. It then lets you share these using any social media and messaging apps.
  <sp>
  Our intended use case is to analyze the activities the user is participating and the objects that they see in real life and translate    them to bitmoji, to share their lives in an interactive way.

    To use, first authorize this app in snapchat using the interface provided.
    
    Once logged in, you will always be directed to select an image or provide your own using the camera.
    
    When you select an image, you will be greeted with the features that match to your image.
    
    When you click a feature, the sticker picker is launched and the feature is copied to the clipboard.
    
    You paste the feature into the search bar and you can click any bitmoji to share it.
    
    The steps are all guided with dialogs at the bottom of the screen.
